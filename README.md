This  software package facilitates the process of generating insight from Australian Mental Health Service data. Specifically the software in this repository describes how we identified : “385 per 1,000 individuals in Australia contacted mental health care services in 2018”. 

The Australian Mental Health Service data was collected from Mental-health-care-service-contact-rate (10.5281/zenodo.4722115)  Zenodo repository that stores information about the community mental health care services across states and territories between 2017 and 2018. We created a Jupyter Notebook called “prepare_and_setup.ipynb” to read this data and extract insight by using Python code.
